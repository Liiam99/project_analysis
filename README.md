# Data Analysis for Bachelor's Thesis
This repository contains the scripts and data I used for my bachelor's thesis. **Main.R** guides you through the analysis.

### Structure
The following list provides the most important directories and files:

- **/data**: contains all the data for the analysis
  - **/data/runs**: contains data for every run including optimal runs.
  - **/data/README.md**: explanation of each run folder.
  - **/data/trees_list.csv**: file containing strategies and GPS coordinates of trees.
- **/results**: contains images of plots created by main.R
- **functions.R**: contains the processing functions to prepare the data for the analysis.
- **main.R**: starting point of the data analysis containing the code for the analyses and visualisations.
